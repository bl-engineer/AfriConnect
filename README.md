# AfriConnect: MERN Stack Social Network App

Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you apply for development jobs, your portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities. Your portfolio showcases high-quality deployed examples of your work, and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

## Project Requirements

Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create.

## Project Motivation:
As a young african entreprenor, i was willing to implement in the nearest future that i am going to work in these couple of month and from wich i might decide to open a startup compagny based here in US that is going to move back to the home continent, Africa in the future. Therefore, i had the idea of a Social Network App like facebook to interconnect great african minds and scientists to be part of shaping the future for the future of the continents.
I called it AfriConnect like connecting Africa and it youth.
